Q2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can use a foreign key constraint.

When you create the "Product" table, you can define a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. 

The "category_id" column is defined as a foreign key that references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.

The inventory_id column references the id column in the Product_Inventory table. This ensures that every product must have a valid inventory entry associated with it.

The discount_id column references the id column in the Discount table. This ensures that every product can have an associated discount, and if it does, the discount must be a valid one.

This ensures that every value inserted into the "category_id","inventory_id","discount" columns of the "Product" table must match an existing "id" value in the "Product_Category",
"Product_inventory","Discount" tables,ensuring referential integrity and guaranteeing that each product has a valid category assigned to it.
